<h1 align="center">welcome to scraping-icp-progects</h1>

This project maintains program code for scraping project information from the [ICP Projects page](https://n7ib3-4qaaa-aaaai-qagnq-cai.raw.ic0.app/) and outputting it to a json file.

When the program execution ends normally, a json file is output in the following format.

Output destination: `./data/dapps.json`
```json
{
  "55": {
    "logo_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1470516138056454148/0wgyA2eE_400x400.jpg",

By editing the .env file, you can change the log level and whether or not to acquire screen captures.
```bash
# Specify whether to acquire screenshots.[true, false]
GET_SCREENSHOT = false
# Choice log level.[debug, error, info, warn]
RUST_LOG = "info"
# Specify output path of json file
DAPPS_JSON_PATH = "./data/dapps.json"
